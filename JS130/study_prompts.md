## LESSON 1
> Implement the following built-in Functions:
> - `forEach`, `filter`, `map`, `reduce`

> Write a `filter` and `map` function to pass to `Array.prototype.reduce`

> ***Use `reduce` to perform:
> - Convert array to object
> - Make two calculations in one traversal
> - map and filter in one pass
> - Run asynchronous functions in sequence
