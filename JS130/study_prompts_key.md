## LESSON 1
> Implement the following built-in Functions:
> - `forEach`, `filter`, `map`, `reduce`

> Write a `filter` and `map` function to pass to `Array.prototype.reduce`

> ***Use `reduce` to perform:
> - Convert array to object
> - Make two calculations in one traversal
> - map and filter in one pass
> - Run asynchronous functions in sequence


## LESSON 2
#### The `var` Keyword
> Explain scoping differences between `var` and `let` / `const`
> - What happens when variables are declared at the top-level?

#### Advanced Scope
> Give an example which shows:
> - local vs global scope
> - inner vs outer scope
> - function vs block scope
>
> What 5 keywords create declared scope? What type of scope for each?
>
> What are the 3 frames of reference of scope?

#### Hoisting
> What are the two phases of hoisting?
>
>

#### Modules
> List the 4 main benefits of using modules
> - Less entangled Code
> - Re-usable Pieces
> - Helps prevent ripple effects in large programs
> - Easier to Encapsulate & Create Private Data

> Implement a CommonJS module with these specs:
> - import a function, variable, and class into a `main` file
> - create private data in the module
> - use destructuring assignment

> Compare CommonJS and JS Module syntax
> - outline key syntax differences
> - list benefits of JS modules
