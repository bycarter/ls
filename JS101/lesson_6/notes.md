## Approach for Lesson 6

- Break down and decompose the problems into smaller pieces.
- Map the flow of the program in a flowchart, using sub-processes to encapsulate distinct components of the problem
- Once approaching a subprocess, write pseudocode for that sub-process. Be sure to understand the INPUTS and OUTPUTS
- Write every line of code, understand it, and be able to articulate it with precision.
- Do all asignments in sequence.
- Use the walk-throughs as *guard rails* and code along.
