// 20. What is the difference between:
// Member access notation & Computed member access notation?
/*
Member access notation (aka Dot Notation) requires a valid variable name in
order to be used.  Computed member access notation evaluates the expression in
the brackets `[ expression ]` and then attempts to access a property with the
evaluated value of said expression.
